# Getting Started

This library provides schema definition of the forms and the libraries for generating [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/) plus processing the form data.
For most users, you don't need to install beanhub-forms.
You can install [beanhub-cli](https://github.com/LaunchPlatform/beanhub-cli) instead if you only want to use it.

To install this library, simply run

```bash
pip install beanhub-forms
```
